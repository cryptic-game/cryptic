# Cryptic

An open-source open-world multiplayer hacking game.

## What is it?!

Cryptic is an deep strategy game.
You start with only one virtual computer ingame and a few crypto coins.
The goal of cryptic is to hack other players and think creative like real hackers.
You must think hard about your actions before attacking another player and learn the basics of the game.
But all in all it's not so hard to start!

Find instructions in our [wiki](https://wiki.cryptic-game.net/books/spielanleitung) (German). 

## I want to play!

Nothing easier than that! Three steps to start:
### 1. Choose a client

Cryptic supports many clients to play.
The most popular is the client for your browser: [click here](https://play.cryptic-game.net/)
But you can also play in an virtual terminal: [cryptic-term](https://github.com/cryptic-game/cryptic-term)

More clients are everywhere in the internet, so it's your choice.

If you want you can develop your own bot or actually a client.

### 2. Choose a server

The main server is hosted on wss://ws.cryptic-game.net/, but you can [host your own](https://github.com/cryptic-game/server) for family and friends.

### 3. Have FUN!

At the end you have to create an account. After that you can become the strongest hacker of cryptic.
