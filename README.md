# Cryptic

An open-source open-world multiplayer hacking game.

## What is it?

Cryptic is an deep strategy game. The goal of this deep strategy game is to hack other players and think creative like real hackers. You only start with a virtual computer and a few crypto coins. You must think carefully about your actions before attacking another player and learn the basics of the game. But it's not hard to get started.  

## How to play the game?

Nothing easier than that. Just three steps to start.

### 1. Choose a client

Play the game in [your browser](https://play.cryptic-game.net/).  

As Cryptic supports many clients to play, you can also play in a virtual terminal, e.g. [PyCrypCli](https://github.com/Defelo/PyCrypCli).  

More clients are available on the internet. If you want, you can even develop your own client. (**Bots are not allowed!**)  

### 2. Choose a server

The main server is hosted on wss://ws.cryptic-game.net/ (and automatically used when you play in the browser), but you can [host your own](https://github.com/cryptic-game/server) for family and friends.

### 3. Create an account and have fun

[Create a Cryptic account to play](https://play.cryptic-game.net/signup) and become the strongest hacker of Cryptic.  

Refer to our [wiki](https://wiki.cryptic-game.net/books/spielanleitung) (German) for instructions or visit our Youtube channel for Let's Play videos.
